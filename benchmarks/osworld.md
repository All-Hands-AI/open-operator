# OSWorld

OSWorld is a first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across operating systems.

## Key Features

- Scalable computer environment supporting multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Unified environment for evaluating open-ended computer tasks
- Supports arbitrary applications and cross-app workflows
- Includes 369 real-world computer tasks with reliable setup and evaluation scripts
- Enables interactive learning and evaluation

## Performance Metrics

Current performance benchmarks:
- Human performance: >72.36% task success rate
- Best model performance: 12.24% success rate
- Models primarily struggle with GUI grounding and operational knowledge

## Task Categories

Tasks span multiple domains including:
- Web applications
- Desktop applications
- OS file I/O operations
- Cross-application workflows
- Real-world use cases

## Technical Infrastructure

- Uses configuration files for task initialization
- Supports agent interaction and post-processing
- Enables file and information retrieval
- Includes execution-based evaluation functions
- Supports parallel environment execution
- Enables headless operation

## Key Statistics

- Total tasks: 369 (plus 43 additional Windows-based tasks)
- Execution-based evaluation functions: 134
- Supports intermediate initialization states
- Enables multimodal interaction
- Allows cross-app task execution
