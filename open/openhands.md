# OpenHands

OpenHands is an open-source AI-powered software development platform that aims to automate various aspects of the software engineering process. It offers a range of features and capabilities that allow developers to streamline their workflow and tackle complex coding tasks more efficiently.

## Key Features

**AI-Powered Agents**
OpenHands utilizes AI agents that can perform a wide array of tasks typically done by human developers[^5]. These agents can:

- Modify existing code
- Run commands
- Browse the web
- Call APIs
- Copy code snippets from sources like StackOverflow

**Integrated Development Environment**
The platform provides a comprehensive workspace that includes:

- Code editor
- Browser agent for web searches
- Jupiter Python tab
- Terminal for command execution
- Sound settings[^9]

**Flexible Model Support**
OpenHands is compatible with various large language models (LLMs), allowing users to choose their preferred provider[^5].

**Open-Source and Accessible**
The platform is freely available on GitHub under the MIT license, promoting transparency and community-driven development[^5].

**AgentHub**
A key feature of OpenHands is AgentHub, a platform where users can contribute their own agents to the community, fostering collaborative development and knowledge sharing[^10].

## Automated Tasks

OpenHands can automate a wide range of software development tasks, including:

1. **Code Generation and Modification**: The platform can create new code or modify existing codebases based on user instructions[^4].

2. **Project Setup**: OpenHands can initialize new development projects, including setting up necessary files and directory structures[^11].

3. **Dependency Management**: It can handle the installation of required modules and manage project dependencies[^11].

4. **GitHub Actions**: The platform can add new GitHub actions to projects, such as setting up linting workflows[^4].

5. **API Development**: OpenHands can create new API routes and endpoints in existing projects[^4].

6. **Frontend Development**: It can generate new React components and integrate them into frontend applications[^4].

7. **Code Refactoring**: The platform can assist in restructuring and optimizing existing code[^2].

8. **Troubleshooting**: OpenHands can help identify and resolve coding issues and bugs[^2].

9. **Documentation**: It can generate and update project documentation[^5].

10. **Version Control**: The platform can interact with git repositories, including cloning, committing changes, and managing branches[^11].

11. **Web Browsing**: OpenHands can perform web searches and extract relevant information for development tasks[^9].

12. **Task Planning**: The planner agent can create long-term plans for complex software development projects[^9].

By automating these tasks, OpenHands aims to increase developer productivity, allowing them to focus on more creative and complex aspects of software engineering while the AI handles routine and time-consuming operations[^5].
