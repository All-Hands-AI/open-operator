# OpenAI Operator

OpenAI's Operator is an autonomous computer use agent that can interact with computers through a visual interface, as announced in their [official release](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/). It uses a specialized Computer Use Assistant (CUA) model to understand and interact with graphical user interfaces.

## Overview

Operator is a web navigation and task automation tool that interacts directly through mouse clicks and screenshots using a new model called CUA (Computer Use Assistant).

## Key Features

### Interface & Interaction
- Uses CUA model for direct mouse click and screenshot interaction
- Similar approach to Anthropic's Computer Use capability
- Includes "take over control" feature allowing users to stop and complete tasks manually
  - In this mode actions are not visible to Operator - users need to make changes and then Operator asks for notes on why the intervention was necessary for further tuning (this is not required by the user)
  - CAPTCHA handling and age-related pop-ups generally requires user intervention. Operator pauses, the user clicks “take over control” to solve it
- Can create and share videos of the interaction. The videos only show the browser interactions and are edited by OpenAI themselves with no way to modify before sharing.
- It can run multiple concurrent tasks (e.g., booking travel and doing research) in parallel
- Tasks are organized in a tab-like interface with real-time notifications, making it easy to track progress and switch between different activities.

### Safety Features
1. Task Filtering
   - Refuses harmful tasks
   - Blocks particular websites
   - Asks for confirmation for potentially risky actions
   - Operator does not retain user credentials across sessions, so each new task that requires a login needs a fresh authentication inside the Operator browser.

2. Monitoring
   - Combines model alignment training with post-hoc detection
   - Monitors for unsafe behaviors
   - Includes confirmation mode (similar to OpenHands)

### Performance
- Benchmarked on standard evaluation frameworks:
  - OSWorld: 38% accuracy
  - WebArena: 58% accuracy using only GUI interface
  - Performs better than published results on these benchmarks

### Current Scope
- Currently focused on web interactions only
- Less expansive than initially expected (no full MacOS integration)
- Polished user interface comparable to OpenHands and other alternatives like MultiOn

## Technical Details
- Uses screenshot-based interaction
- No access to accessibility tree or text modality
- Direct mouse control through CUA model
- Includes safety monitoring and confirmation systems

## Limitations
- Web-only functionality
- Requires user communication for non-visible actions
- Limited to browser-based tasks

## Future Potential
- May help increase awareness of agent capabilities
- Could drive community efforts around:
  - Matching accuracy benchmarks
  - Improving agent safety
  - Developing better evaluation metrics

## Related Projects
- Similar to Anthropic's Computer Use capability
- Comparable to OpenHands functionality
- Benchmarked against WebArena and OSWorld standards
