# Zapier

Zapier is a powerful automation tool that allows users to connect different apps and automate workflows without any coding. Here are some key features and tasks that Zapier allows you to automate:

## Key Features

**Zaps**: These are automated workflows that connect your apps to do tasks automatically[^1]. Each Zap consists of a trigger (the event that starts the automation) and one or more actions (the tasks that follow)[^14].

**Multi-Step Zaps**: These allow you to create complex workflows involving multiple actions and steps[^6].

**Filters and Paths**: You can use filters to ensure your Zaps only run when certain conditions are met. Paths allow for branching logic, making your workflows more dynamic[^6].

**Webhooks**: Send or receive data from any service with webhooks, allowing for even more flexibility in your automated workflows[^6].

**Schedule by Zapier**: This feature lets you automate recurring tasks on a set schedule, without relying on a trigger from another app[^13].
